<!DOCTYPE html>  <!--Task: Create an additional CSS class called blue-text that gives an element the color blue. Make sure it's below your pink-text class declaration.

Apply the blue-text class to your h1 element in addition to your pink-text class, and let's see which one wins.

Applying multiple class attributes to a HTML element is done with a space between them like this:

class="class1 class2"

Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.

However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section are what is important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because .blue-text is declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text -->
